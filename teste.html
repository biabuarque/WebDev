          <h2>Coffee grains are the best snack ever made</h2>
          <p>
            I know, I know—this might sound like an unpopular opinion, but
            hear me out. The idea of munching on coffee grains as a snack 
            might raise a few eyebrows, but it's a notion worth exploring. 
            Curiosity has always been a driving force for humanity, leading 
            us to discover new tastes and experiences. It was this same 
            curiosity that led me to pop a coffee grain into my mouth for 
            the first time. The result? A delightful revelation that I 
            believe deserves more attention.
          </p>
          <h3>Brazil and Coffee (Every family has its own Rory and Lorelai)</h3>
          <p>
            Living in Brazil, coffee isn't just a beverage; it's a cultural 
            staple. As the world's largest producer of coffee, Brazil 
            contributes approximately one-third of global coffee production. 
            This deep-rooted connection to coffee permeates our daily lives, 
            much like the Gilmore Girls' infamous coffee addiction. In many 
            Brazilian households, it's not uncommon to enjoy a cup of coffee 
            late into the evening. Over time, this habitual consumption has 
            desensitized many of us to its stimulating effects, making coffee 
            a comforting constant rather than just a morning pick-me-up.
          </p>
          <h3>The diet bitter overexpensive snack of the week</h3>
          <p>
            Now, let's talk about coffee grains as a snack. At first glance, 
            it might seem unconventional, but consider this: coffee beans are 
            low in calories and packed with antioxidants. A 50-gram serving 
            contains about 260 calories. That means each individual coffee 
            bean has roughly 5.2 calories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Comparatively, many low-calorie snacks on the market are both 
            expensive and less satisfying. Imagine purchasing a trendy 
            health snack that costs a small fortune and leaves you hungry 
            an hour later. Now, consider a serving of 30 coffee grains. At 
            approximately 5.2 calories per bean, that's a mere 156 calories. 
            If we estimate the cost of coffee beans at $0.12 per gram, and 
            with each bean weighing about 1 gram, a 30-bean snack would 
            cost around $3.60.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sure, it's a bit on the pricey side for a snack, but isn't that 
            the hallmark of the latest fitness trends? Overpriced, slightly
             bitter, and touted by influencers as the next big thing. So, 
             here's my (sarcastic) prediction: soon, we'll see fitness 
             enthusiasts swapping their kale chips for artisanal, hand-roasted 
             coffee bean snacks. After all, nothing says "health-conscious" 
             like chewing on the source of your morning brew.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, while it might not be for everyone, snacking on 
            coffee grains offers a unique combination of flavor, cultural 
            homage, and a nod to the ever-evolving landscape of health trends. 
            Give it a try—you might just find yourself reaching for a handful 
            of beans instead of that energy bar.

          <h2>Ghibli inspired AI Art is TRASH</h2>
          <p>
            Seemingly overnight, the internet has been flooded with AI-generated 
            images mimicking the enchanting style of Studio Ghibli. Tools like 
            ChatGPT and DALL-E have made it effortless for anyone to transform 
            photos or prompts into Ghibli-esque artworks. While many casual 
            observers find this trend harmless and amusing, a significant portion 
            of the artistic community has voiced strong opposition. This raises 
            important questions about the role of artificial intelligence in art, 
            especially when it encroaches upon the creative domains of established 
            artists. While AI-generated art can be intriguing and innovative, it 
            crosses a line when it infringes upon the rights and styles of living 
            artists. In the case of Hayao Miyazaki, the mastermind behind Studio 
            Ghibli, his explicit disapproval of AI art suggests that, despite the 
            technological capability to replicate his style, we should refrain 
            from doing so out of respect for his artistic integrity.
          </p>
          <h3>On Hayao Miyazaki</h3>
          <p>
            Hayao Miyazaki, born in 1941, co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985 and 
            has since become a monumental figure in the world of animation. His 
            films, such as My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke, 
            are celebrated for their hand-drawn artistry, complex characters, and 
            profound narratives that often explore themes of nature, pacifism, and 
            humanism. Miyazaki's dedication to traditional animation techniques is 
            not merely a stylistic choice but a reflection of his belief in the 
            transformative power of art. He views the painstaking process of creating 
            animation by hand as integral to the development of an artist's character 
            and worldview. This philosophy underscores his conviction that the essence
            of art lies in the human experience and the emotions imbued by the creator. 
            Artificial intelligence, in his view, lacks the capacity to understand or 
            replicate this depth of human sentiment. In a 2016 documentary, upon being 
            shown AI-generated animation, Miyazaki remarked that it was "an insult to 
            life itself," expressing profound discomfort with the notion of removing 
            human intention and emotion from the creative process.
          </p>
          <h3>Why it is disrespectful</h3>
          <p>
            The replication of an artist's unique style through artificial means raises 
            significant ethical and philosophical concerns. Art is not merely about the 
            end product but encompasses the journey of creation—the struggles, insights, 
            and personal growth that the artist experiences. By using AI to mimic the 
            distinctive style of a creator like Miyazaki, we risk trivializing the years 
            of dedication and the deeply personal process that contribute to such artistry. 
            This act can be seen as a form of intellectual theft, stripping the original 
            work of its context and meaning. Moreover, it undermines the value of human 
            creativity, suggesting that the nuances of an artist's vision can be reduced to 
            algorithms and data sets. Respecting Miyazaki's stance on AI art means 
            acknowledging the irreplaceable nature of human touch in creative endeavors. 
            Instead of seeking shortcuts through technology to replicate his life's work, 
            aspiring artists should engage with the medium directly, embracing the challenges
            and rewards that come with genuine creation. This approach not only honors the 
            legacy of artists like Miyazaki but also fosters originality and personal expression in art.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, while AI technology offers fascinating possibilities, its application 
            in replicating the unique styles of living artists without consent is both 
            disrespectful and ethically questionable. Hayao Miyazaki's clear opposition to 
            AI-generated art serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of preserving 
            the human essence in creative works. As consumers and creators, we have a 
            responsibility to respect the boundaries set by artists and to value the irreplaceable 
            qualities that human creativity brings to art.
