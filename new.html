            <h2>Coffee grains are the best snack ever made</h2>
            <p>
              I know, I know—this might sound like an unpopular opinion, but
              hear me out. The idea of munching on coffee grains as a snack 
              might raise a few eyebrows, but it's a notion worth exploring. 
              Curiosity has always been a driving force for humanity, leading 
              us to discover new tastes and experiences. It was this same 
              curiosity that led me to pop a coffee grain into my mouth for 
              the first time. The result? A delightful revelation that I 
              believe deserves more attention.
            </p>
            <h3>Brazil and Coffee (Every family has its own Rory and Lorelai)</h3>
            <p>
              Living in Brazil, coffee isn't just a beverage; it's a cultural 
              staple. As the world's largest producer of coffee, Brazil 
              contributes approximately one-third of global coffee production. 
              This deep-rooted connection to coffee permeates our daily lives, 
              much like the Gilmore Girls' infamous coffee addiction. In many 
              Brazilian households, it's not uncommon to enjoy a cup of coffee 
              late into the evening. Over time, this habitual consumption has 
              desensitized many of us to its stimulating effects, making coffee 
              a comforting constant rather than just a morning pick-me-up.
            </p>
            <h3>The diet bitter overexpensive snack of the week</h3>
            <p>
              Now, let's talk about coffee grains as a snack. At first glance, 
              it might seem unconventional, but consider this: coffee beans are 
              low in calories and packed with antioxidants. A 50-gram serving 
              contains about 260 calories. That means each individual coffee 
              bean has roughly 5.2 calories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comparatively, many low-calorie snacks on the market are both 
              expensive and less satisfying. Imagine purchasing a trendy 
              health snack that costs a small fortune and leaves you hungry 
              an hour later. Now, consider a serving of 30 coffee grains. At 
              approximately 5.2 calories per bean, that's a mere 156 calories. 
              If we estimate the cost of coffee beans at $0.12 per gram, and 
              with each bean weighing about 1 gram, a 30-bean snack would 
              cost around $3.60.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sure, it's a bit on the pricey side for a snack, but isn't that 
              the hallmark of the latest fitness trends? Overpriced, slightly
               bitter, and touted by influencers as the next big thing. So, 
               here's my (sarcastic) prediction: soon, we'll see fitness 
               enthusiasts swapping their kale chips for artisanal, hand-roasted 
               coffee bean snacks. After all, nothing says "health-conscious" 
               like chewing on the source of your morning brew.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, while it might not be for everyone, snacking on 
              coffee grains offers a unique combination of flavor, cultural 
              homage, and a nod to the ever-evolving landscape of health trends. 
              Give it a try—you might just find yourself reaching for a handful 
              of beans instead of that energy bar.
